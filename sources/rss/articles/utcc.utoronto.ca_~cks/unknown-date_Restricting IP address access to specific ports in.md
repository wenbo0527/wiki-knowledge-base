## 摘要

<div class="wikitext"><p>The other day I covered <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/SystemdSocketIPRestrictions">how I think systemd's IPAddressAllow and
IPAddressDeny restrictions work</a>, which
unfortunately only allows you to limit this to specific (local)
ports only if you set up the sockets for those ports in a separate
<a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.socket.html">systemd.socket</a>
unit. Naturally this raises the question of whether there is a good,
scalable way to restrict access to specific ports in eBPF that
systemd (or other interested parties) could use. I think the answer
is yes, so here is a sketch of how I think you'd this.</p>

<p>Why we care about a 'scalable' way to do this is because systemd
generates and installs its eBPF programs on the fly. Since tcpdump
can do this sort of cross-port matching, we could write an eBPF
program that did it directly. But such a program could get complex
if we were matching a bunch of things, and that complexity might
make it hard to generate on the fly (or at least make it complex
enough that systemd and other programs didn't want to). So we'd
like a way that still allows you to generate a simple eBPF program.</p>

<p>Systemd uses <a href="https://docs.ebpf.io/linux/program-type/BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SKB/">cgroup socket SKB eBPF programs</a>, which
attach to a cgroup and filter all network packets on ingress or
egress. As far as I can understand from staring at code, these are
implemented by extracting the IPv4 or IPv4 address of the other
side from the SKB and then querying what eBPF calls a <a href="https://docs.ebpf.io/linux/map-type/BPF_MAP_TYPE_LPM_TRIE/">LPM (Longest
Prefix Match) map</a>. The
normal way to use an LPM map is to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing">CIDR</a>
prefix length and the start of the CIDR network as the key (for
individual IPv4 addresses, the prefix length is 32), and then match
against them, so this is what systemd's cgroup program does. This
is a nicely scalable way to handle the problem; the eBPF program
itself is basically constant, and you have a couple of eBPF maps
(for the allow and deny sides) that systemd populates with the
relevant information from IPAddressAllow and IPAddressDeny.</p>

<p>However, there's nothing in eBPF that requires the keys to be just
CIDR prefixes plus IP addresses. A <a href="https://docs.ebpf.io/linux/map-type/BPF_MAP_TYPE_LPM_TRIE/">LPM map</a> key
has to start with a 32-bit prefix, but the size of the rest of the
key can vary. This means that we can make our keys be 16 bits longer
and stick the port number in front of the IP address (and increase
the CIDR prefix size appropriately). So to match packets to port
22 from 128.100.0.0/16, your key would be (u32) 32 for the prefix
length then something like 0x00 0x16 0x80 0x64 0x00 0x00 (if I'm
doing the math and understanding the structure right). When you
query this <a href="https://docs.ebpf.io/linux/map-type/BPF_MAP_TYPE_LPM_TRIE/">LPM map</a>, you put the appropriate port number in front
of the IP address.</p>

<p>This does mean that each separate port with a separate set of IP
address restrictions needs its own set of map entries. If you wanted
a set of ports to all have a common set of restrictions, you could
use a normally structured <a href="https://docs.ebpf.io/linux/map-type/BPF_MAP_TYPE_LPM_TRIE/">LPM map</a> and a second <a href="https://docs.ebpf.io/linux/map-type/BPF_MAP_TYPE_HASH/">plain hash map</a> where the
keys are port numbers. Then you check the port and the IP address
separately, rather than trying to combine them in one lookup. And
there are more complex schemes if you need them.</p>

<p>Which scheme you'd use depends on how you expect port based access
restrictions to be used. Do you expect several different ports,
each with its own set of IP access restrictions (or only one port)?
Then my first scheme is only a minor change from systemd's current
setup, and it's easy to extend it to general IP address controls
as well (just use a port number of zero to mean 'this applies to
all ports'). If you expect sets of ports to all use a common set
of IP access controls, or several sets of ports with different
restrictions for each set, then you might want a scheme with more
maps.</p>

<p>(In theory you could write this eBPF program and set up these maps
yourself, then use systemd resource control features to <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.resource-control.html#IPIngressFilterPath=BPF_FS_PROGRAM_PATH">attach
them to your .service unit</a>.
In practice, at that point you probably should write host firewall
rules instead, it's likely to be simpler. But see <a href="https://kailueke.gitlab.io/systemd-bpf-firewall-loader/">this blog post</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pothos/bpf-cgroup-filter">the
related VCS repository</a>,
although that uses a more hard-coded approach.)</p>
