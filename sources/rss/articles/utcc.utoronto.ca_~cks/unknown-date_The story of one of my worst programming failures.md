<div class="wikitext"><p>Somewhat recently, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@GeePawHill/116129976624712032">GeePaw Hill shared the story of what he called
his most humiliating experience as a skilled and successful computer
programmer</a>.
It's an excellent, entertaining story with a lesson for all of us,
so I urge you to read it. Today I'm going to tell the story of one
of my great failures, where I may have quietly killed part of a
professor's research project by developing on a too-small machine.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, back when I was an (advanced) undergraduate, I
was hired as a part time research programmer for a Systems professor
to work on one of their projects, at first with a new graduate
student and then later alone (partly because the graduate student
switched from Systems to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction">HCI</a>). One
of this professor's research areas was understanding and analyzing
disk IO patterns (a significant research area at the time), and my
work was to add <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/DiskCacheHitMissWantDetails">detailed IO tracing</a>
to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrix">Ultrix</a> kernel. Some
of this was porting work the professor had done with the 4.x BSD
kernel (while a graduate student and postdoc) into the closely
related, BSD-derived Ultrix kernel, but we extended the original
filesystem level tracing down all the way to capturing block IO
traces (still <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/DiskCacheHitMissWantDetails">specifically attributed to filesystem events</a>).</p>

<p>We were working on Ultrix because my professor had a research and
equipment grant from DEC. DEC was interested in this sort of
information for improving the IO performance of the Ultrix kernel,
and part of the benefit of working with DEC was that DEC could
arrange for us to get IO traces from real customers with real
workloads, instead of university research system workloads. Eventually
the modified kernel worked, gathered all the data that we wanted
(and gave us <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/KernelNameCachesWhy">some insights even on our systems</a>), and was ready for the customer site.
We talked to DEC and it was decided that the best approach was that
I would go down to Boston with the source code, meet with the DEC
people involved, we'd build a kernel for the customer's setup, and
then I'd go with the DEC people to the customer site to actually
boot into it and turn the tracing on.</p>

<p>Very shortly after we booted the new kernel on the customer's machine
and turned tracing on, the kernel paniced. It was a nice, clear
panic message from my own code, basically an assertion failure, and
what it said was more or less 'disk block number too large to fit
into data field'. I looked at that and had a terrible sinking
feeling.</p>

<p>This was long enough ago (with small enough disks) that having very
compact trace data was extremely important, especially at the block
IO layer (where we were generating a lot of trace records). As a
result, I'd carefully designed the on-disk trace records to be as
small as possible. As part of that I'd tried to cut down the size
of fields to be only as big as necessary, and one of the fields I'd
minimized was the disk block address of the IO. My minimized field
was big enough for the block addresses on our Ultrix machines
(donated by DEC), with not very big disks, but it was now obviously
too small for the bigger disks that the company had bought from DEC
for their servers. In a way I was lucky that I'd taken the precaution
of putting in the size check that paniced, because otherwise we
could have happily wasted time collecting corrupted traces with
truncated block addresses.</p>

<p>(All of this was long enough ago that I can't remember how small
the field was, although my mind wants to say 24 bits. If it was 24
bits, I had to be using 4 Kbyte filesystem block addresses, not
512-byte sector addresses.)</p>

<p>Once I saw the panic message, both the mistake and the fix were
obvious, and the code and so on were well structured enough that
it was simple to make the change; I could almost have done it on
the spot (or at least while in Boston). But, well, you only get one
kernel panic from your new "we assure you this is going to work"
kernel on a customer's machine, especially if you only have one
evening to gather your trace data and you can't rebuild a kernel
from source while at the customer's site, so the DEC people and I
had to pack up and go back empty handed. Afterward, I flew back to
Toronto from Boston, made the simple change, and tested everything.
But I never went back to Boston for another visit with DEC, and I
don't think that part of my professor's research projects went
anywhere much after that.</p>

<p>(My visit to Boston and its areas did feature getting driven around
at somewhat unnervingly fast speeds on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Turnpike">Massachusetts Turnpike</a> in the sports
car of one of the DEC people involved.)</p>

<p>So that's the story of <a href="https://mastodon.social/@cks/116132912535266993">how I may have quietly killed one of
my professor's research projects by developing on a too-small
machine</a>.</p>

<p>(That's obviously not the only problem. When I was picking the field
size, I could have reached out somehow to ask how big DEC's disks
got, or maybe ran the field size past my professor to see if it
made sense. But I was working alone and being trusted with all of
this, and I was an undergraduate, although I had significant
professional programming experience by then.)</p>

<h3>Sidebar: Fixing an earlier spectacular failure</h3>

<p>(All of the following is based on my fallible memory.)</p>

<p>The tracing code worked by adding trace records to a buffer in
memory and then writing out the buffer to the trace file when it
was necessary. The BSD version of the code that I started with
(which traced only filesystem level IO) did this synchronously,
created trace records even for writing out the trace buffer, and
didn't protect itself against being called again. A recursive call
would deadlock but usually it all worked because you didn't add too
many new trace records while writing out the buffer.</p>

<p>(Basically, everything that added a trace record to the buffer
checked to see if the buffer was too full and if it was, immediately
called the 'flush the trace buffer' code.)</p>

<p>This approach blew up spectacularly when I added block IO tracing;
the much higher volume of records being added made deadlocks
relatively common. The whole approach to writing out the trace
buffer had to change completely, into a much more complex one with
multiple processes involved and genuinely asynchronous writeout.
I still have a vivid memory of making this relatively significant
restructuring and then doing a RCS ci with a commit message that
included a long, then current computing quote about replacing one
set of code with known bugs with a new set of code with new unknown
ones.</p>

<p>(At this remove I have no idea what the exact quote was and I can't
find it in a quick online search. And unfortunately the code and its
RCS history is long since gone.)</p>
